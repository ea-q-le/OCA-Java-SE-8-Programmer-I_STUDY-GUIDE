-------------------------------------------------
=================================================
-------------------------------------------------


ANSWERS with EXPLANATIONS are given below
Q1: +
	A_E: variables within methods have to be initiated
		 should you forget it, the compiler will throw an error
		 when trying to use it

Q2: -
	A_C: since the first two variables are String elements, 
		 both == and .equals() will return true, 
		 these two elements are referring to the same element at String pool
		 HOWEVER, .toString() creates a value, not a String pool element
		 and .equals() will turn the sb1 StringBuilder() into a 
		 String element which in result will be elementally equal to s1
		 hence, 3 times 'true' will be printed

Q3: ua
	A_C: the method getTailLength() in the interface HasTail is assumed to be
		 public, since it is part of an interface. 
		 The implementation of the method on line 3 is therefore an invalid 
		 override, as protected is a more restrictive access modifier
		 than public, so option C is correct.
	A_D: the class Cougar implements an overloaded version of
		 getTailLength(), but since the declaration in the 
		 parent class Puma is invalid, it needs to implement a 
		 public version of the method. 
		 Since it does not, the declaration of Puma is invalid.
	A_E: Puma is marked abstract and cannot be instantiated.

Q4: -
	A_C: The code compiles and runs without issue. 
		 This type of problem is best examined one loop iteration at a time:
		 1) The loop continues as count loop expression evaluates to 0 < 3,
		 which is true, with y taking a new value of 1. 
		 The value of y is set to:
		 	y = (1 + 2 * 1) % 3
		 	  = (1 + 2) % 3
		 	  = 3 % 3
		 	  = 0
		 2) The first case block is called and the value of x is then 
		 set to:
		 	x = 3 - 1 = 2
		 3) The loop continues as count loop expression evaluates to 
		 1 < 3, which is true, with y taking a new value of 2. 
		 The value of y is set to:
		 	y = (1 + 2 * 2) % 3
		 	= (1 + 4) % 3
		 	= 4 % 3
		 	= 2
		 4) The default block is called and the value of x is set to:
			x = 2 - 1 = 1
		 5) The loop continues as the count loop expression evaluates to 
		 2 < 3, which is true, with y taking a new value of 3. 
		 The value of y is set to:
		 	y = (1 + 2 * 3) % 3
		 	= (1 + 6) % 3
		 	= 7 % 3
		 	= 1
		 6) The second case block is called and the value of x is 
		 then set to:
		 	x = 1 + 5 = 6
		 7) The loop ends as the count loop expression evaluates 
		 to 3 < 3, with y also taking a new value of 4. 
		 The most recent value of x, 6, is output.

Q5: -
	A_D: The code starts running and prints a and b on lines 13 and 15. 
		 Line 16 throws an exception, which is caught on line 17. 
		 After line 18 prints c, 
		 the finally block is run and d is printed. 
		 Then the try statement ends and e is printed on line 22.

Q6: -
	A_B: The code compiles successfully. 
		 The value of a cannot be changed by the addToInt method, 
		 no matter what the method does, because only a copy of the 
		 variable is passed into the parameter x. 
		 Therefore, a does not change and the output on line 9 is 15.

Q7: +
	A_B: The array is allowed to use an anonymous initializer because 
	 	 it is in the same line as the declaration. 
	 	 The ArrayList uses the diamond operator allowed since Java 7. 
	 	 This specifies the type matches the one on the left 
	 	 without having to re-type it. 
	 	 After adding the two elements, list contains [6, 8]. 
	 	 We then replace the element at index 1 with 9, resulting in [6, 9].
	 	 Finally, we remove the element at index 0, leaving [9].

Q8: -
	A_A: The code compiles and runs without issue.
		 First, the Reindeer object is instantiated using the 
		 constructor that takes an int value. 
		 Since there is no explicit call to the parent constructor, 
		 the default no-argument super() is inserted as the first line
		 of the constructor. The output is then Deer, 
		 followed by Reindeer in the child constructor.
		 Next, the method hasHorns() looks like an overridden method, 
		 but it is actually a hidden method since it is declared 
		 private in the parent class. Because the hidden method is 
		 referenced in the parent class, the parent version is used, 
		 so the code outputs false.

Q9: ua
	A_B: Only checked exceptions are required to be handled 
		 (caught) or declared.
	A_C: Errors are intended to be thrown by the JVM. 
		 While a programmer could throw one, this would be a horrible
		 practice.

Q10: 2/3
	A_C: Immediately after line 9, only Grasshopper g1 is eligible 
		 for garbage collection since both one and two point to 
		 Grasshopper g2.
	A_D: Immediately after line 10, we still only have Grasshopper g1 
		 eligible for garbage collection. 
		 Reference one points to g1 and reference two is null.
	A_F: The code does compile. Although it is traditional to declare 
		 instance variables early in the class, you don’t have to.
		 If you missed it, the private String name; is declared 
		 at line 13.

Q11: -
	A_B: The code compiles. The loop iterations are as follows:
		 1) the outer loop i is 0, so the loop continues.
		 1-1) i is updated to 1 and x to 6. 
		 	  The if-then statement branch is not executed, 
		 	  and x is increased to 10 and j to 1.
		 1-2) (since j = 1 and 1 <= 2), i is updated to 2 and x to 11. 
		 	  At this point, the if-then branch will evaluate to true 
		 	  for the remainder of the program run, which causes the 
		 	  flow to break out of the inner loop each time it is reached.
		 2) (since i = 2), i is updated to 3 and x to 12. 
		 As before, the inner loop is broken 
		 since x is still greater than 10.
		 3) the outer loop is broken, as i is already not less than 3. 
		 The most recent value of x, 12, is output.

Q12: -
	A_B: Line 10 calls the constructor on lines 3–5. 
		 That constructor calls the other constructor.
		 However, the constructor on lines 6–8 assigns the method 
		 parameter to itself, which leaves the color instance variable 
		 on line 2 set to its default value of null.

Q13: +
	A_C: The code compiles and runs.
		 Within the ternary, since luck is not less than 10, 
		 the second expression --luck will be evaluated.
		 Due to pre-increment, the value of luck is 9.
		 Since 9 is less than 10, the first if statement will
		 execute and print Bear. 
		 Since luck (9) is still less than 10, the second if statement
		 will also execute and print Shark.

Q14: -
	A_D: If house.getChickens() returns an array of one element, 
		 the code will output Cluck once.
	A_E: If house.getChickens() returns an array of multiple elements, 
		 the code will output Cluck once for each element in the array.
	A_F: If house.getChickens() returns an array of zero elements, 
		 then the code will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException on 
		 the call to house.getChickens().get(0).
		 The code will also throw an exception if the array 
		 returned by house.getChickens() is null.

Q15: 3+1/3
	A_A: The for-each loop automatically casts each Tadpole object 
	A_C: to an Amphibian reference, which does not require an explicit cast 
	A_E: because Tadpole is a subclass of Amphibian. 
		 From there, any parent class or interface that Amphibian inherits
		 from is permitted without an explicit cast. 
		 This includes CanSwim, the interface Amphibian implements, 
		 and Object, which all classes extend from.
		 Option C is also correct since the reference is being cast 
		 to the same type, so no explicit cast is required.

Q16: 2/3
	A_F: The code does not compile, since a class cannot inherit 
	A_G: two interfaces that both define default methods with 
		 the same signature, unless the class implementing the interfaces
		 overrides it with an abstract or concrete method.
	A_D: The alternate approach is to make the getName() method abstract 
		 in the interfaces, because an interface may inherit two
		 abstract methods with the same signature. 
		 The change must be made to both interfaces, though.

Q17: ua
		 The only functional programming interface you need to memorize 
		 for the exam is Predicate. 
		 It takes a single parameter and returns a boolean.
	A_A: Lambda expressions with one parameter are allowed to
	A_C: the parentheses around the parameter list.
	A_F: The return statement is optional when a single statement 
		 is in the body.

Q18: 2+1/2
		 As of Java 8, APIs use static methods rather than constructors.
		 Therefore, the methods are called directly without creating
